The structure of this Net class is shown below and left for you to fill in.\n",

    "Next, you'll see a helper function. `visualize_output` that takes in a batch of images, predicted keypoints, and ground truth keypoints and displays a set of those images and their true/predicted keypoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function's main role is to take batches of image and keypoint data (the input and output of your CNN), and transform them into numpy images and un-normalized keypoints (x, y) for normal display. The un-transformation process turns keypoints and images into numpy arrays from Tensors *and* it undoes the keypoint normalization done in the Normalize() transform; it's assumed that you applied these transformations when you loaded your test data."

    "Training a network to predict keypoints is different than training a network to predict a class; instead of outputting a distribution of classes and using cross entropy loss, you may want to choose a loss function that is suited for regression, which directly compares a predicted value and target value. Read about the various kinds of loss functions (like MSE or L1/SmoothL1 loss) in [this documentation](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/_modules/torch/nn/modules/loss.html).\n",

    "Sometimes, neural networks are thought of as a black box, given some input, they learn to produce some output. CNN's are actually learning to recognize a variety of spatial patterns and you can visualize what each convolutional layer has been trained to recognize by looking at the weights that make up each convolutional kernel and applying those one at a time to a sample image. This technique is called feature visualization and it's useful for understanding the inner workings of a CNN."

    "## Feature maps\n",
    "\n",
    "Each CNN has at least one convolutional layer that is composed of stacked filters (also known as convolutional kernels). As a CNN trains, it learns what weights to include in it's convolutional kernels and when these kernels are applied to some input image, they produce a set of **feature maps**. So, feature maps are just sets of filtered images; they are the images produced by applying a convolutional kernel to an input image. These maps show us the features that the different layers of the neural network learn to extract. For example, you might imagine a convolutional kernel that detects the vertical edges of a face or another one that detects the corners of eyes. You can see what kind of features each of these kernels detects by applying them to an image. One such example is shown below; from the way it brings out the lines in an the image, you might characterize this as an edge detection filter.\n",
